## Student View Updates

We made the following changes to enhance the student experience and simplify interaction with the system:

- **Removed the “Quick Action” option** from the profile, as it was counterproductive and required too many steps to access the desired area.  
- **Removed notification icons**, since verification pop-ups already provide the necessary feedback to students.  
- **Removed notification preferences** from the profile, as the notification feature is no longer used.  
- **Simplified the profile section** by removing the *University* field in the *Edit Profile* section, as it was redundant.  
- **Removed privacy settings** from the profile, as they were deemed unnecessary for the current functionality.  
- **Updated the login process** to a **single, unified login system** for all users, ensuring consistency and responsiveness across devices.  
- **Added OTP functionality** for account creation and password recovery within the unified login system.  
- **Refined geo-location functionality** by removing the map interface. Instead, the lecturer’s laptop now serves as the verification hub, and students’ locations must match it to confirm attendance.

## Lecturer’s View Updates

We made the following changes to improve functionality and usability for lecturers:

- **Removed the “Download QR” link** from the schedule, as it was redundant. Attendance can now be manually marked if students experience issues.  
- **Removed the “Import Classes” option** from the timetable, as this functionality is already available on the home page.  
- **Removed the “Add Class” button** from the timetable view, since it already exists on the home page.  
- **Added scrollbars** to the *“Today’s Classes”* and *“Your Modules”* sections for easier navigation.  
- **Updated the class creation process** — the calendar is now displayed as a pop-up, and class duration can be specified.  
- **Simplified the profile section** by removing the *Department*, *Contact Number*, and *University* fields.  
- **Replaced profile pictures** with automatically generated initials-based avatars.  
- **Enhanced module creation** by adding an *“Add Tutor”* option, which grants tutors access only to the modules they are assigned to.
