#### Module-Level Variation
- **WEB301**: Base rate 82% ± 10% weekly variation = 72-92% attendance
- **NET401**: Base rate 88% ± 10% weekly variation = 78-98% attendance  
- **SWE501**: Base rate 75% ± 10% weekly variation = 65-85% attendance

#### Student-Level Variation
- Each student has individual attendance tendency ± 15%
- Final attendance rate per student per class: 50-95%
- Some students are "good attenders" (consistently high)
- Some students are "poor attenders" (consistently low)
- Most students vary week to week realistically

#### Implementation Details
- Only "present" records are inserted (absent = no record)
- Location varies slightly (±100m) from base coordinates
- GPS accuracy varies (5-20m)
- Check-in time varies (-5 to +5 minutes from class start)

### 📁 Files Created

2. **`generate_new_modules.py`**

   - Can be modified and rerun if needed

## Expected Database State After Migration

### Before (from terminal output)
- 👥 Users: 104
- 📚 Modules: 2
- 🎓 Classes: 34

### After Migration
- 👥 Users: 104 (unchanged)
- 📚 Modules: **5** (2 + 3 new)
- 🎓 Classes: **~120** (34 + 86 new)
- 📝 Attendance records: **Thousands** (varied, not 100%)

## Lecturer Assignment
All 3 new modules are assigned to:
- **Lara Lecturer** (`lara.lecturer@example.edu`)

## Tutor Assignment
- **WEB301**: Tia Tutor
- **NET401**: Tom Tutor  
- **SWE501**: Tia Tutor

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Fresh Database (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Remove existing database
rm clock_it.db

# Restart server (applies all migrations in order)
cargo leptos watch
```

### Option 2: Existing Database
```bash
# Migrations apply automatically on server start
cargo leptos watch
```

The migration system (sqlx) will:
1. Check `_sqlx_migrations` table
2. Apply only new migrations (20251111000000_add_three_modules.sql)
3. Track that it's been applied

## Verification

After the migration runs, you should see in terminal:
```
✅ Database migrations completed successfully!
📊 Database state:
   👥 Users: 104
   📚 Modules: 5
   🎓 Classes: ~120
```

## Attendance Statistics to Expect

When viewing module statistics, you should see:
- **ISM101** (original): ~100% attendance (if using original data)
- **DBA201** (original): ~100% attendance (if using original data)
- **WEB301** (new): ~72-92% attendance (varies by week)
- **NET401** (new): ~78-98% attendance (varies by week)
- **SWE501** (new): ~65-85% attendance (varies by week)

Each student will have individual attendance patterns, and weekly attendance will fluctuate realistically.

## Notes

- The migration uses the same timestamp format as existing data
- Student emails match exactly from the original migration
- Class sessions are created for all completed classes
- GPS coordinates are based on Stellenbosch University location
- The `created_by` field is set to `lara.lecturer@example.edu` for all new classes

# Remove old migration
rm migrations/20251111000000_add_three_modules.sql
